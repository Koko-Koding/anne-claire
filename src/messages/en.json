        "content": "Anne-Claire van Putten is the most knowledgeable person I have ever met when it comes to natural medicine, herbs, and vitamins. She assesses my overall well-being and evaluates my organs by testing pressure points in my body. Initially, I consulted her for help with improving my sleep, but to my astonishment, she accurately outlined my entire medical history simply by analysing my organs. I was truly blown away."

      "title": "The Five Nature-Oriented Principles",
      "content": "Since 2013 I am a registered member of the BATC (Anne-Claire van Putten with AGB code 90048965). The reason I chose this professional organisation is because the BATC developed the concept of the fi ve nature-oriented principles. In my working methods, I incorporate these important principles: energy, stimulus transition, drainage, food and mental well-being. This is part of my holistic view on health matters. **Energy** is seen as the basis of life worldwide. Everything in and around us consists of energy. And energy also forms the basis of my treatments and my thinking. It is a priority to ensure that there is a balanced fl ow of energy and that blockages can be removed. Stimulus transmission takes place via the nervous system which is the communication network of the body. The stimulus transfer also ensures that certain signals, for example about what you need for recovery, are passed on to the body. Good stimulus transfer is essential for being able to function and recover well. Drainage is important when there are too many waste products in the body, e.g. in our intestines, nutrients can no longer be absorbed properly. Under favourable conditions, our body is able to excrete most waste products without problems via our excretory organs. But our body itself can create an overload of waste products because, for example, our lymphatic system or blood circulation does not function optimally. It can be desirable to support and stimulate the body in this. Food maintains your cells and provides them with fuel. Our daily diet is one of the most important components for a fi t and healthy body and a sharp mind. Certain foods are not tolerated equally well by everyone. This can be a temporary issue. Through nutritional advice and taking in special natural supplements this can change in a positive way. Mental well-being is important for proper functioning of the body. Emotional, mental and spiritual aspects infl uence your health. Awareness of your thoughts and behavioural patterns are obviously important. This applies for mental, but also physical well-being."

    "about": {
      "title": "About Anne-Claire van Putten (1960)",
      "content": "After graduating from the University of Amsterdam with a degree in Communication Science, I worked as a non-fi ction editor for many years. However, I eventually felt the need for a change in direction. My long-standing interest in natural medicine, combined with my fi rsthand experience of measuring the energy of meridians, led me to pursue various forms of education: naturopathy, Eas- tern medicine, psychology and spirituality. Through this journey, I gained deep insights into physiological proces- ses, human behaviour, and trauma. I studied at the Hogeschool voor Natuurgeneeswij zen (College for Naturopathy) in Arnhem, where my curiosity was immediately drawn to the healing power of herbs and, later, other natural elements such as minerals found in the Earth. I continue to be amazed by the intricate ways in which organs work together within the human body and the profound effects of natural remedies in supporting these functions organically. In my view, recovery and well-being are deeply personal processes. The best approach is one that is tailored to the individual, focusing on personalised solutions that meet their unique needs. Thank you, dr. Annelies Tak, Hilje de Meester- Wagenvoorde and Madelon Hooykaas for your knowledge, wisdom and support. With gratitude, Anne-Claire"
